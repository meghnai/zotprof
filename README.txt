HOW TO RUN PROGRAM:
1) cd into inf-133-final-project folder
2) from terminal, run "python myScraper.py"


IMPORTANT NOTE ABT REQUIREMENTS:
We decided to forego the "Average Grade Received" requirement we initially
had in our proposal. We did write the functionality for it, but it is not 
included in the HTML. The reason being is because the website 
https://zotcourse.appspot.com/ already calculates average grade distribution
for a specific class taught by a specific professor. Additionally, many
students do not give their grade received on RateMyProfessor, so there could
be a bias (ex. only students who received good grades would post their grade
received). We felt that it would not be a useful calculation for our users to
see. 


ADDED FEATURES:
-> Calculating average quality/difficulty will also display how many ratings 
   it is out of
-> Can delete and clear all cards
-> Even after creating multiple cards, can go back to a previous card and 
   change the course for that professor, and it will recalculate averages
